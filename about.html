		<p>My name is Morgan. I spent my entire life in a small town near Lake Michigan before I journeyed to MSU (go green!). During high school I was heavily involved with the performing arts; theatre and music were my life. However, there was always one other interest that nobody else seemed to share- technology.<strong> Let me tell you this: </strong>there's nothing quite like a small town, poorly-funded high school to discourage you from pursuing computer science. They still don't have a single PC that isn't running Windows XP. Yikes.</p><p> I pulled through, though. When I graduated I'd known for several years that I wanted to study computer science at a large university- where I could find plenty of other students with just as much passion as me. Maybe the love came from years spent around computers or maybe it's just my inner nerd. Probably both, eh?</p>
		<p>Whatever it was that fueled/fuels the fire, I'm excited to start my career in CS. If you can stick around, I'd love it if you could check out my work by clicking a link above.<p>
