		<p>Allow me to introduce myself- my name is Morgan.  I spent my entire life in a small town on Lake Michigan before I journeyed to MSU (go green!).  I'd known for several years that I had a thirst for technology that could only be quenched if I studied computer science at a large university- where I could find plenty of other students with just as much passion as me.  Maybe the love came from years spent around computers (I distinctly remember signing up for an email account at age 9) or maybe it's just my nerdy brain.  Probably both, eh?</p>
		<p>Whatever it was that fueled (and continues to fuel) the fire, I'm excited to start my career in CS. If you can stick around, I'd love it if you could check out my work by clicking a link above.<p>
