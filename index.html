		<p>My name is Morgan.<br />I'm a sophomore computer science major at<br />Michigan State University, located in East Lansing, MI.</p>
		<p>When I'm not grooving away on bass guitar, watching movies,<br />or slaving through homework, I guarantee you<br />I'm geeking out on my macbook.</p>
		<p>
			I may even be coding.<br />

		<h2 class="header orange">About</h2>
		<p>For the first eighteen years of my life I lived near a harbor town on<br />Lake Michigan named Ludington (population ~10,000). I attended<br />the same school district for twelve years, and in May of 2014<br />I graduated from there alongside 85 other students.</p>
		<p>I&#39;m hoping these small numbers resonate with whomever is reading, because they&#39;re important to understanding my journey to Computer Science.</p>
		<p>Less than 10% of high schools in the U.S. are certified to teach Computer Science- my school was certainly not one of them. No one I knew or spoke with during my years in primary school had ever touched coding, and I was too intimidated to ever dig deeper than MySpace HTML/CSS (haha).</p>
		<p>Passion for technology has always been prevalent in my life. Senior year I was struggling to find a major that could stimulate my creativity but also provide financial stability. I love music (bass guitar &amp percussion) and theatre, but neither have viable job growth. That was when I found Computer Science- a degree that compliments years of technological growth I experienced from middle school to high school and continue to experience today.</p>
		<p>The next thing I knew, I ended up at Michigan State University- Go GREEN. I&#39;m currently in my sophomore year pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. I&#39;ve finally started to get my feet wet with programming. I know Python, some JavaScript, and am competent in HTML/CSS.</p>
		<p>More is soon to come!</p>
